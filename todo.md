# TODO

Below should be fixed before we consider release this on crates.io

Feel free to send bug fixes or improvements. Note I have only access to STM32F205.
Most of the pinouts should be compatible with stm32f207 and stm32f215.

## TBD

 - [ ] Fix warnings
 - [ ] Fix RCC
 - [ ] Fix examples
 - [ ] Support more than stmf205
