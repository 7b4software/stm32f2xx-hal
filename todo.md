# TODO

Below should be fixed before we consider release this on crates.io

Feel free to send bug fixes or improvements. Note I have only access to STM32F205.
Most of the pinouts should be compatible with stm32f207 and stm32f215.

## TBD

 - [ ] Fix warnings
 - [ ] Fix RCC (some is currently hardcoded)
 - [ ] Fix all examples
 - [x] Support LAN on stm32f2x7
 - [x] Update gpio to use the new gpio API
